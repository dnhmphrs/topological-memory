<h2>What is a Space?</h2>

<p>
	A <strong>space</strong> is a set equipped with structure that gives meaning to notions of
	nearness, continuity, or geometry. The specific structure determines what kind of space we have.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p><strong>Topological Space:</strong> A set X with a collection of open sets satisfying:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The empty set and X are open</li>
	<li>Arbitrary unions of open sets are open</li>
	<li>Finite intersections of open sets are open</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<strong>Metric Space:</strong> A set X with a distance function d: X × X → ℝ satisfying the metric
	axioms (positivity, symmetry, triangle inequality).
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Manifold:</strong> A topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space, with smooth
	transition maps between coordinate charts.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Algebraic Variety:</strong> Solution sets to polynomial equations, equipped with the
	Zariski topology.
</p>

<h3>Zariksi Topology - do I need this?</h3>

<h2 id="schemes">Schemes</h2>

<!-- <p>
	A <strong>scheme</strong> is a locally ringed space (X, 𝒪<sub>X</sub>) where every point has an
	open neighborhood isomorphic to the spectrum of a commutative ring.
</p>

<p>More precisely:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Spec(A):</strong> For a commutative ring A, the spectrum Spec(A) is the set of prime
		ideals of A, equipped with the Zariski topology
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Structure Sheaf:</strong> 𝒪<sub>X</sub> is a sheaf of rings on X that encodes the
		"functions" on the space
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Locally Ringed:</strong> Stalks 𝒪<sub>X,x</sub> at each point x are local rings
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Schemes unify algebraic and geometric perspectives: points correspond to prime ideals, and
	functions correspond to elements of rings. This generalizes classical algebraic varieties and
	allows nilpotent elements, giving schemes the power to capture infinitesimal structure.
